This is the repository hosting a draft version of the CMMR website.

It's built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)


Attn CMMR group:
Updating the website is as simple as editing the file on github, then saving it. A "Github Actions" workflow will handle the rest.

However, if you want to edit in a little more detail, I'd recommend [installing Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) locally for testing.
