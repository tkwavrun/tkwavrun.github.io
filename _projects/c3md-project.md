## Aim

Exciting new research project supported by AFRL. Michigan Technological University researchers, in collaboration with Florida State University, Columbia University, and Penn State will develop the next-generation of composite materials for hypersonic aerospace vehicles. These composites will have significantly improved manufacturability and thermo-mechanical performance relative to state-of-the-art composites. The material development will be driven by multi-scale computational modeling.
